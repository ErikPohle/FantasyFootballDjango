FantasyFootballDjango

About This Project: 
I am a <b> big </b> fan of fantasy of football, so I spend a lot of time choosing who I want to play. My idea is simple, I want to spend less time deciding who I play so I have more time to do other things. So I'm creating this. What is <b>this</b>? This is going to be a website, where you input your <b>league id</b> and <b>league year</b> and in response get information youregarding your teams rank, win/loss ratio, overall record, etc. Then when I gather enough data I will create projections and graphs via <b>numpy</b> and <b>pandas</b>.
